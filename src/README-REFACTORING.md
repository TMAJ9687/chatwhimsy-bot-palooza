# Codebase Refactoring Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring approach taken to improve the application by:

1. Eliminating direct DOM manipulation
2. Creating a more declarative React-based UI system
3. Centralizing modal and dialog management
4. Improving performance and reducing redundancy

## Key Changes

### 1. New React-Based Context System

We've implemented a central `UIContext` that handles:
- Dialog state management
- Body scroll locking
- Modal registration/tracking

This replaces the previous approach that relied on direct DOM manipulation.

### 2. New Hooks

- `useDialog`: For managing dialog windows
- `useModal`: For managing modals and overlays
- Both use the central `UIContext` for coordinated state management

### 3. Deprecation of DOM Services

The following services have been deprecated:
- `DOMCleanupService`: Replaced with React-based state management
- `DOMOperationQueue`: No longer needed for the new declarative approach
- `DOMSafetyUtils`: No longer needed for DOM manipulation

### 4. Component Refactoring

Components have been refactored to:
- Use the new context system rather than direct DOM manipulation
- Rely on React's built-in lifecycle methods for cleanup
- Improve performance with proper memoization

## Migration Guide

For existing components:
1. Replace `useDialog` imports to use the new hook from `@/hooks/useDialog`
2. Replace direct DOM manipulation with React state and effects
3. For modals, use the `useModal` hook to register/manage modal state
4. For dialogs, use the `useDialog` hook to open/close dialogs

## Benefits

This refactoring offers several benefits:
- More predictable state management
- Better performance through reduced DOM operations
- Improved developer experience with simpler, more declarative APIs
- Better compatibility with React's rendering model
- Reduced side effects and potential memory leaks

## Future Improvements

- Further componentization of UI elements
- Additional performance optimizations through memoization
- Type improvements for better developer experience
