# Firebase to Supabase Migration

This document outlines the transition from Firebase to Supabase in our application.

## Completed Changes

1. **Authentication**
   - Replaced Firebase Auth with Supabase Auth
   - Updated all authentication flows
   - Created new auth service (src/services/auth/supabaseAuth.ts)

2. **Storage**
   - Replaced Firebase Storage with Supabase Storage
   - Created storage buckets:
     - standard-uploads: For regular user content
     - vip-uploads: For VIP user content
     - profile-images: For user profile pictures
   - Implemented migrations for existing content
   - Created new storage utilities (src/utils/storageUtils.ts)

3. **Components**
   - Updated all components that were using Firebase services
   - Removed Firebase-specific code

## Migration Helpers

- Created migration utilities to help transition existing data (src/utils/migrationUtils.ts)
- Added SQL setup for Supabase storage buckets (supabase/migrations/storage_setup.sql)

## Setup Instructions

For Supabase storage to work properly, you'll need to run the SQL migration script:

1. Go to the Supabase Dashboard for your project
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Run the contents of supabase/migrations/storage_setup.sql

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement server-side Firebase to Supabase data migration
- [ ] Create a script to automate migration of existing users and content
- [ ] Enhance error handling for edge cases during migration

## Files Removed

- src/firebase/config.ts
- src/firebase/auth.ts
- src/firebase/storage.ts
- src/firebase/firestore.ts
- src/firebase/firestore/* (all files in this directory)
